You know the game Wordle which is basically *the* thing in the internet lately? The following words have been proposed to be ideal to start guessing with as they cover a lot of common letters:

* SIREN (or RISEN, they have the same effect)
* OCTAL
* DUMPY

According to how many matches you have with SIREN you might consider also gussing OCTAL and even DUMPY.

I wanted to know these words for a German version of Wordle, and especially also different numbers of letters. Here are my results:

Assume vowels are as important as consonants:

| 4 letters | 5 letters | 6 letters | 7 letters |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| RENS      | ERNST     | INSERT    | ANREIST   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| THAI      | GHALI     | LOCHAU    | LOGBUCH   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| KLUG      | DUMPF     |           |           |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| ODBC      |           |           |           |
